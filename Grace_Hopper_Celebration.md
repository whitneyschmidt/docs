When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." Still she persisted. “It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols,” she explained. “So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.”

Code reviews facilitate **knowledge transfer** and **relationship building**.

It’s proven that **diverse teams** produce **better products**.

Anyone can and should review!

🌟 Questions can be more powerful than statements

    - Posing suggestions as questions
    - Asking questions!

👏 Give compliments

## How Universities are Creating New Pathways to Diversify Tech

**Colleen Lewis** Associate Professor of Computer Science, Harvey Mudd
**Carla Brodley** Professor & Dean, Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern
**Valerie Barr** Jean Sammet Professor of CS, Mount Holyoke
**Andrea Danyluk** Professor of CS, Williams College

The tech industry should broadly represent those it affects, yet many groups remain underrepresented.

By providing new pathways into computing and changing the way that we teach, we can create a diverse applicant pool.

🌉 Bridge Program

- 2 semesters that funnel into any CS masters program
- Kids decide what field they want to study at age 17
- Create diversity in what people were doing *before* CS
- 🌟 Pathways for those of us that that didn’t know that we had an interest in CS!

🎨 Interdisciplinary CS

- Create a computing requirement outside of CS, like the foreign language requirement
- Not everyone can major in CS
- Set of students outside CS is more diverse than in CS
- 🌟 Give all majors an opportunity to learn the core concepts of computing

💻 Making CS accessible

- Create different classes for different levels of experience
- Open class by setting expectations in a positive way
- Office hours and TA availability
- 🌟 Enable everyone to succeed in their intro class, regardless of different levels of exposure


## [Uncovering Human Trafficking Networks Through Text Analysis](http://signage.showprg.com/ghc19/6b7a145d-ed62-48ff-80d7-24569183f279-95827-Lin-Li.pdf)
## *Lin Li, MIT Lincoln Laboratory*

Currently, law enforcement receives local tips, shuts down one outpost, but the larger human trafficking networks are not disrupted.

How do we help law enforcement uncover the organization, rather than small local operation outposts?


1. Use template matching to uncover text patterns that correspond to organized activities
2. Group templates by shared language → templates that are used by the same organization
3. Group by phone # to map geographical clusters
4. Map templates to geographical locations to identify organizations that span several locations
5. Train a model to rate ads 0 - 1 based on how likely they are to be actual trafficking threats 

**20x more cases handled by law enforcement using this** **software**

## 💭 Closing thoughts

**How to get the most out of GHC**

- Attend the keynotes
- Talk to people! - whether it’s in line for a talk, at a networking event, or at a theme park
- Don’t expect to make it to every session, take time to eat and connect
- Attend the career fair, it’s a great way to get a pulse on the industry
